# Steampunk Raiders

This repository contains the Steampunk Raiders prototype client that is now organised as a standard Vite + React workspace.

## Repository layout

- `GameState-Steampunk-main/` – application source code
- `.git/` – Git metadata

The legacy archive that previously stored the source has been removed. All active development happens inside `GameState-Steampunk-main/`.

## Getting started

1. Navigate into the app directory: `cd GameState-Steampunk-main`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
